                <td class="output"><pre>Based on the provided information, here's a recommended diet plan for an Olympic weightlifter with these specifications:

Nutritional Approach:
1. Protein Intake
- Target: 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight
- Approximately 160-240g of protein daily
- Sources: Lean meats, fish, eggs, gluten-free protein powders (whey isolate, beef protein)

2. Carbohydrates
- Focus on complex, gluten-free carbs
- Sources: 
  - Sweet potatoes
  - Rice (white/brown)
  - Quinoa
  - Gluten-free oats
- Timing: Emphasize carbs around training sessions

3. Fats
- Healthy fats for hormone production and recovery
- Sources:
  - Avocados
  - Nuts (almonds, walnuts)
  - Olive oil
  - Fatty fish

4. Meal Timing
- Pre-workout: Easily digestible protein and carbs
- Post-workout: High protein, moderate carbs for recovery
- 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day

5. Supplements
- Creatine monohydrate
- Glutamine
- Omega-3 fish oils
- Vitamin D
- Electrolyte supplements

Hydration: 3-4 liters of water daily</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">While the solution provides a solid nutritional framework, it fails to meet the mandatory requirements of specifying daily caloric intake, exact meal compositions, and precise macronutrient percentages. The approach is sound, but lacks the specific implementation details required for a complete meal plan.</td>

Macronutrient Breakdown:
- Carbohydrates: 55-65% of total calories
- Protein: 15-20% of total calories
- Healthy Fats: 20-25% of total calories

Daily Calorie Intake:
- Estimated around 2,600-2,800 calories (depending on training intensity)

Key Nutrition Recommendations:
1. Protein Sources:
- Tofu
- Tempeh
- Seitan
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Quinoa
- Plant-based protein powders
- Nuts and seeds

2. Complex Carbohydrates:
- Whole grains
- Sweet potatoes
- Brown rice
- Oats

4. Key Supplements:
- Vitamin B12
- Iron
- Omega-3 (algae-based)
- Vitamin D
- Zinc

Meal Timing:
- Pre-run: Easily digestible carbs
- Post-run: Protein and carb recovery meal
- Hydration: 2-3 liters of water daily

Consultation with a sports nutritionist is recommended for personalized advice.</pre></td>
